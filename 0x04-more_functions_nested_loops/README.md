**Tasks for the project 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**

**Task 0** - File 0-isupper.c - C function that checks if a character is uppercase or not;

**Task 1** - File 1-isdigit.c - C function that checks if a character is a digit or not;

**Task 2** - File 2-mul.c - C function that multiplies two integers;

**Task 3** - File 3-print_numbers.c - C function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line;

**Task 4** - File 4-print_most_numbers.c - C function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4, followed by a new line;

**Task 5** - File 5-more_numbers.c - C function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line; 

**Task 6** - File 6-print_line.c - C function that draws a straight line in the terminal;

**Task 7** - File 7-print_diagonal.c - C function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal;

**Task 8** - File 8-print_square.c - C function that prints a square, followed by a new line;

**Task 9** - File 9-fizz_buzz.c - C program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three it prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five it prints Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints FizzBuzz;

**Task 10** - File 10-print_triangle.c - C function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line;

**Task 11** - File 100-prime_factor.c - C program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line;

**Task 12** - File 101-print_number.c - C function that prints an integer.
